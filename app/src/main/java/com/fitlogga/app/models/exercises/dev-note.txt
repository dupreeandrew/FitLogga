For now, every time an Exercise is generated, it's completed status is always set to false.

The original plan was to make it so that the completion status would be saved to HDD, and then
every week, completion status for every exercise would be reset to false...

This was the primary reason I wanted the "complete" constructor parameter to exist.

However, I am now having doubts about this original plan.
It will be easy to undo this commit if I ever change my mind.
